Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational machine learning models to process and understand natural language. These models are trained on massive amounts of text data to learn patterns in the language. LLMs can perform many types of language tasks, such as translating languages, analyzing sentiments, chatbot, conversational agents, and much more.
